# How can improve a Feedforward Neural Network results?



I am using a [Feedforward Neural Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedforward_neural_network) architecture from [Synaptic.js](https://caza.la/synaptic/) to draw StackOverflow's logo entirely from NN's activation.



### Can a feedforward neural network achieve this result? If not, why? If yes, how?\*\*
