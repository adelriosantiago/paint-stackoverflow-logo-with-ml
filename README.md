# How to improve drawing accuracy of this Feedforward Neural Network (FFNN)?

I have this simple Feedforward Neural Network architecture:

![](./architecture.jpg)

For simplicity, this FFNN has 2 inputs, 15 hidden layers and 3 outputs.

And I want it to learn how to draw StackOverflow's logo:

![](./so.bmp)

For simplicity, this logo is 125 width by 125 height BMP at 255 colors.

The problem is


 - Librarie used: [Synaptic.js](https://caza.la/synaptic/)
 - This example in localhost [in this repo](https://github.com/adelriosantiago/paint-stackoverflow-logo-with-ml).


### Can a feedforward neural network achieve this result? If not, why? If yes, how?\*\*
