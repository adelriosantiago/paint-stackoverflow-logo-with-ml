# How to improve drawing accuracy of this Feedforward Neural Network (FFNN)?

And I want it to learn how to draw this StackOverflow's logo:

![](./so.bmp)

This logo is 125 width by 125 height BMP at 255 colors for simplicity.



I am using a [Feedforward Neural Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedforward_neural_network) architecture from [Synaptic.js](https://caza.la/synaptic/) to draw StackOverflow's logo entirely from NN's activation.

### Can a feedforward neural network achieve this result? If not, why? If yes, how?\*\*
